# pinecone: A JavaScript->Lua converter

So, I wrote a JS->Lua converter. Instead of being based on regex or some other dumb idea, it's based on [acorn][acorn], an awesome and superfast JavaScript Annotated Source Tree (AST) generator. Pinecone takes that and turns it into mostly-valid Lua.

It was written by running `$ acorn try.js > try.json` and looking at the JSON over and over, so don't expect very good standard conformity.

## The Wall
Pinecone has almost hit the wall. There isn't much that can still be done, due to a couple key issues with how JavaScript and Lua are different:
* `..` used for concatinating strings
* How JS/Lua handle types
* `typeof k === 'object'` -> `type(k) == 'object'`. Lua doesn't have that.
* JS object literals and Lua tables
* `"4" == 4` is true in JS, but false in Lua.
* Should things like `console.log` be turned into `print`?

This can be handled in a couple different ways, but none are very good options.

## What works
* Variables `var a = 1`
* Multiple Variables `var a = 1, b = 2`
* Changing variables `a = 2`
* Functions `function a() { return 1 }`
* Functions declared as variables `var a = function () { return 1 }`
* If/ifelse/else
* `typeof thing` (turned into `type(thing)`)
* Graceful failing
* While loops
* Do While loops (converted to `repeat` loops)

## What doesn't
* Comments
* For loops
* Everything else


## Usage
**CLI**
````text
$ npm install -g pinecone
$ pinecone file.js -o file.lua
````

**Programmically**
````js
var pinecone = require('pinecone'); // npm install pinecone
var input = "var k = 9;";

pinecone.convert(input);
//Alternatively, if you already have the AST:
pinecone.convertFromAST(require('acorn').parse(input, {}));

````


## Example
````js
var k = 'blue', b, f = 12;

var p = 4;

if (typeof k == 'string') {
  print('String!');
}

function bacon() {
  return 'bacon';
}

var f = function () {

};
````
turns into
````lua
--# Converted using pinecone v0.1.0

local k, b, f = "blue", nil, 12
local p = 4
if type(k) == "string" then
  print("String!")

end
function bacon()
  return "bacon"

end
local f = function() end
````

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Use two spaces for tabs, and try to keep your code looking like the rest of it.
Make sure your code passes a jshint lint. Outputted Lua code made from JS code that passes jshint (that pinecone fully supports) should pass luac.
